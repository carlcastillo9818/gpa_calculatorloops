# gpa_calculatorloops
This program asks for a student name, ID number, and the number of courses he/she is taking.  
For each course, it asks for the course number, course credits, and grade received for the course.  
Then it calculates the students GPA average by dividing the total grade points by the total course credits.  
It displays the students name, their ID number, the total number of semester credits, their GPA and a 
warning/congratulary message depending on their GPA number. 
Finally, it asks the user if they want to run the program again for another student.
